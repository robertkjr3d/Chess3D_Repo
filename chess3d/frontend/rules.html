    <p>The QuadLevel battlefield: four interconnected boards forming one game</p>
  </div>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Set Up</h2>
  <p>QuadLevel uses four half‑boards stacked vertically (4×8×4). Two complete sets of chessmen are required – including two Kings and two Queens. On the top level the white Knight begins on a white square, followed by the sequence Rook, Knight, Bishop, Rook. Queens begin on their own color as in classical chess. The ideal view is from the long side with your pieces on the left, playing left to right.</p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>The Three‑Dimensional Concept</h2>
  <p>Traditional chess uses X and Y movement. QuadLevel adds the Z dimension. Pieces move normally on each flat board (X–Y plane) and may also move in the rotated Y–Z plane. This preserves the spirit of chess while opening a vertical battlefield.   See the <a href="https://youtu.be/sPimrlwx13Y" target="_blank">Youtube video</a></p>

  </div>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Change In Distance Rule (CID)</h2>
  <p>Diagonal movement must change the distance between players. A piece starting on flank A must remain on flank A when changing boards. Pawn, Knight, and Bishop moves must advance or retreat toward the opponent. This keeps Bishops and Knights from roaming the back ranks and preserves game balance.  Watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/5n9JP4kUl0I" target="_blank">In defense of the CID</a> Video</p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Piece Movement</h2>

  <h3>Pawn</h3>
  <p>Advances one square (two on first move). Captures diagonally ahead on the same board, up one board, or down one board. En‑passant and promotion operate as in classical chess.</p>
  <div class="figure"><img src="images/image007.jpg" alt="Pawn Movements"></div>

  <h3>Bishop</h3>
  <p>Moves diagonally on its color in eight directions across levels. Range is limited by the 4‑square board depth.</p>
  <div class="figure"><img src="images/image008.jpg" alt="Bishop Movements"></div>

  <h3>Rook</h3>
  <p>Moves in straight lines across rows, columns, and vertically between boards with unlimited range.</p>
  <div class="figure"><img src="images/image009.jpg" alt="Rook Movements"></div>

  <h3>Knight</h3>
  <p>L‑shaped jump: two squares/boards in one direction and one in another. Knights jump over pieces and retain much of their classical strength.</p>
  <div class="figure"><img src="images/image010.jpg" alt="Knight Movements"></div>

  <h3>Queen</h3>
  <p>Combines powers of Bishop and Rook across all levels.</p>

  <h3>King</h3>
  <p>Kings move one square in any direction.</p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h3>Castling</h3>
  <p>Four castling options exist for each King – toward edges or between levels – provided no squares are attacked and the pieces involved have not moved.  In each case a Bishop and a Knight must be out of the way, as you must imagine the pieces slide like the arrows.</p>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Estimated Power Values</h2>
  <p>Pawn 1 • Knight 2.85 • Bishop 2.85 • Rook 4 • Queen 8</p>
  <p>In the beginning my father insisted that the power was the same as regular chess. Later I thought as others that first initially studied the game, that the Bishop was under powered, Later I came to realize in practice, that the Bishop is not. Trading Bishops for Knights is not a power move.</p>
</section>

<section class="card">
  <h2>Check, Mate, and Draw</h2>
  <p>A King in check must be defended immediately. Checkmate occurs when no legal defense exists. Standard draws include repetition, 50‑move rule, and stalemate. Watch the <a href="https://youtu.be/o24qqy68u5o" target="_blank">Two Kings YouTube</a></p>

  <h2>Standard Version</h2>
  <p>The game ends, when either King is Checkmated or a Double Check fork cannot be stopped.</p>

  <h2>Original Variant – “Destroy Both Kings”</h2>

  <p>When a King is checkmated, it is removed from the board and the remaining King becomes <b>locked</b> (it may not move).</p>

  <ul>
    <li style="margin-left:40px">A locked King may still be captured, even by a simple check.</li>
    <li style="margin-left:40px">If both Kings are in check simultaneously, the player chooses which King is removed (a rare “Sophie’s choice”); the other retreats to safety and becomes locked.</li>
  </ul>

  <p><b>Exceptions:</b></p>
  <ul>
    <li style="margin-left:40px">A stalemate unlocks the King.</li>
    <li style="margin-left:40px">An opposing King may not capture by moving adjacent to the locked King.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Notation</h2>
  <p>Format: {Piece}{Level}{Column}{Rank}. Example: 1) 2c4 2c5. Castling example: 2O‑O1.</p>
